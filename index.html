        <h2>To Listen or Not to Listen</h2>
        <p>
            There are times that I truly cannot tell if my 4 year old son is choosing not to listen to me, or if he is hyper-focused on an activity that he seriously cannot hear me.  When he gets this way it is like he is in a trance and I have to snap him out of it just to get him back into this world. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is something that we are working on with his behavioral specialist, since she is having the same issues during their sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone else experience this?

        <h2>To Medicate or not to Medicate</h2>
        <p>
           This has to be one of the hardest decisions a parent can make. You don't want to "drug" your child, but there comes to a point when you've tried everything and don't know what else to do. Your child is out of control, on the verge of being kicked out of school or daycare, and you are going out of your mind. If you've ever felt this way, you are not alone!
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost a year before my husband and I decided to go the medication route, we removed all dyes and artificial flavorings from our son's diet, experimented with a gluten free and dairy free diet, strict routines, occupational therapy, sessions with a physcologist, reward/behavioral charts and then finally a pychiatrist. We even changed from our own churches daycare and preschool to a Montessori school in hopes that would help. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Jamieson was diagnosed with ADHD, ODD and Anxiety.  We made the tough decision to put our son on anxiety medication. After six weeks, and experimenting with the dosage, our son was finally able to start putting his fears and anxiety aside. He has had 7 weeks of great days at school and is making friends and socializing. I have no regrets making this decision.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind, we are still doing behavioral therapy once a week, keeping up the, "I kept my hands to myself" reward chart and focusing on the positives.  I can't say that the medication is the ony thing that is helping, but I have no doubt in my mind it is reducing his anxiety and allowing him to just be a kid and not worry so much.

        <h2>Time Out</h2>
        <p>
            Time out never seemed to work, until I ran into the "Super Nanny Time Out" method. If you've never hear of it, do yourself a favor and google it. At first, it is frustrating. Basically, you have one time spot. You tell your child why they are going to time out. They have to stay in time out for the selected amount of minutes (usually one minute per age of the child, I only started with 2 minutes for my 4 year old son), and if they get up you have to put them back in time out and restart the time.  The first time I did this with my son it took over 30 minutes for him to stay in time out for 2 minutes straigt. The more times you use this method the quicker it will take them to do their time.  The key is, you must be consistent every single time, or this will not work.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proud to say, that in the past 5 weeks, we have only had to put my son in time out once! This is a huge improvement. 
        <p>
            Anyone else have any success with time outs?
